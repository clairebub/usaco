//
// You typically need to import the classes in these two packages,
// It's like the python import sys, io, that's the place where a lot of useful library
// functions reside.
//

//
// Here are the steps to prepare for how USACO exercises:
// 1. learn how to read from the file and write to files, which include
// 1.a read a line
// 1.b read an integer, a double, and a string from a line
// 1.c write an integer, a double and a string to a file, with or without a new line
// 2. read the numbers into a list, map, pairs
// And then, the real challenge starts, how do you solve the problems with the data structures of list/map/pair. It
// typically involved:
// 2.a loop and double loop
// 2.b sometimes recursion
// most of all, analyse the problems
